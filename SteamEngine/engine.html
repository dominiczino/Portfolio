		<p style="text-align:center">How Modern Technology can Improve Antiquated Machines</p>

		<p style="text-align:center">Most people would consider the steam engine an obsolete machine from a bygone era, and hardly worth any scholarly research today. However, in many areas of the world, steam engines are still a viable (if not superior) prime mover. Sugar cane mills in particular often still use steam engines in places like Cuba, Java, India, and even Australia! Steam engines still have unique advantages that allow their use to persist, such as extremely high torque, virtually indefinite service life (many of those sugar-mill engines are over 100 years old, despite 24-7 operation), self-starting capability, the ability to run in reverse without a transmission, and the ability to use practically any fuel. Steam engines only need steam, which could come from a boiler burning basically anything at all, from wood to garbage to peat or biomass to coal to oil to sawdust. This is especially serendipitous if the fuel is a byproduct of the industrial process at hand; for instance, many steam-powered sawmills burn the sawdust in their boilers, and steam-power sugar cane mills can burn the bagasse. They are not dependant on electricity or expensive refined fuels like gasoline that are hard to come by in rural areas of third-world countries. The off-grid advantages of steam engines could make them an incredibly useful tool for developing nations.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center">The trouble with steam engines comes with their design. The design of steam engines was effectively ended by the invention of the steam turbine, and so almost no advances in reciprocating engine design came about after the 1920s, except in railroads, where they continued for just a few more decades before disappearing. This means that steam engine design has really never been scrutinized by modern analytic tools like electronics and computers. Steam engine valve gears are still exclusively mechanical linkages with notable disadvantages and imperfections, as well as very high complexity. Low-power operation requires throttling the steam intake to reduce the pressure, which results in large reductions in efficiency when the engine operates at low output relative to it's designed power. The power-to-weight ratios are often low, because engines have not been built using modern materials, and are instead almost entirely cast-iron. Bearing surfaces are generally journal bearings, with almost no engines using modern ball or roller bearings. </p>
    <p style="text-align:center">My proposed research consists of building a steam engine that will address some of these problems and rigorously testing it to see what improvments can be made to the reciprocating steam engine by application of modern methods. To this end, I have purchased the parts to build a steam engine following a mostly traditional design, except it has modern ball-bearings. This engine will be tested extensively on dynomometers and it's efficiency and performance carefully recorded. Then I intend to remove the valve gear entirely and replace it with a system of my own design which will allow for computer control of the valves. Using this system, many different control regimes can be tested and analyzed. The engine can be run as a twin-cylinder engine or as a compound. It can run with extremely low cutoff without the excessive compression that would come with a mechanical valve gear. Because the valves can be manually controlled, it will even allow for the engine to be stopped, started, and reversed without the need for a throttle, allowing full pressure steam to always be used, maximizing the efficiency of the engine and the economical use of the steam.</p>
