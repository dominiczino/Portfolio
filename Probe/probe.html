    <p style="text-align:center">I decided to make a touch probe for a future plan to make a CMM. My initial design was to use a flexible plastic component fitted with strain gauges to measure tiny deflections of the probe tip to detect a contact. However, as it turns out, strain gauges are not the easiest things to use. They're actually really small and soldering leads to them is hard, especially on a plastic substrate. Even then, it requires tricky amplification and resistor bridges to detect the tiny changes in the resistance of the gauge. I'm sure I could get it to work eventually if I kept trying, but I decided to get some practice with strain gauges seperately, and then try this again once I know how to get them to work. In the meantime, I went to a simple electrical contact inside the probe that is broken when the probe body is pushed one way or another. This is not as reliable since it requires more bending of the probe, but it should be very simple to implement. This project is currently on hold.</p>
