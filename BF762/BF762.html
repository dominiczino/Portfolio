    <p style="text-align:center"> I wanted to build a higher-powered rifle with a locked breech for a while, and why not make a belt-fed rifle too? Since a belt-fed rifle will obviously go through a lot of ammunition so this limited me to cheap cartridges for economic reasons. That meant I had to go with, basically, .22lr, maybe 9mm, 5.56mm, or 7.62x39mm. The first two are a little too light for what I wanted. From the last two, 7.62x39 is more powerful while having lower pressures and more case taper, which makes it easier to work with.</p>
