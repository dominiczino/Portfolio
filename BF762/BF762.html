    <p style="text-align:center"> I wanted to build a higher-powered rifle with a locked breech for a while, and why not make a belt-fed rifle too? Since a belt-fed rifle will obviously go through a lot of ammunition so this limited me to cheap cartridges for economic reasons. That meant I had to go with, basically, .22lr, maybe 9mm, 5.56mm, or 7.62x39mm. The first two are a little too light for what I wanted. From the last two, 7.62x39 is more powerful while having lower pressures and more case taper, which makes it easier to work with.</p>
		
	<p style="text-align:center"> The design uses a toggle-locked system, similar to the Luger pistol. When the gun is in battery, the toggle is slightly over-center, preventing the bolt from opening. However, unlike the Luger, which unlocks the toggle via recoil operation, the BF762 is gas-operated. A gas piston is pushed <i>forward</i> by the high-pressure gas from a port under the barrel, pulling on a linkage that forces the toggle open. By designing the gas piston to be pulled forward instead of pushed backwards, the piston rod is kept under tension, so that it can be made smaller without buckling. The bolt features vertical grooves that engage with a round from the belt and pull it backwards out of the belt. A flat spring forces the cartridge to slide down the grooves, displacing the previous case and aligning the new cartridge with the chamber. When the bolt closes again, the top of the grooves spring over the next round in the belt. Feeding the belt forward is done via a set of pawls on the left side of the gun, which push the next round into position as the bolt reaches it rearmost position, due to the action of a cam on the bottom of the piston rod.</p>
		
	<p style="text-align:center"> The gun is also air-cooled, featuring a large aluminum finned jacket around the barrel. This outer shell of this jacket extends beyond the muzzle, so when the gun fires the muzzle blast will force air to be drawn through the finned jacket, helping to keep the gun cool during sustained fire. (Of course, this is still just a semi-automatic gun, but heat could still be an issue, especially with the slightly questionable steel used for my barrels) </p>
		
	<p style="text-align:center"> The barrel itself is also interesting. This is my first attempt at rifling a barrel via electro-chemical machining (ECM). This method promises very easy and clean rifling without requiring special tools like buttons and hydralic presses. This works by fitting a non-conductive core into the bore that has grooves cut into its outside in the reverse of the rifling. Conductive copper wires are fitted into the base of these grooves. Then salt water is pumped through the grooves, and a voltage is applied between the copper wires and the barrel. Current flows through the salt water to the barrel, but only in the portions of the barrel that the core has left exposed (i.e. the grooves). In under 20 minutes, the current and salt will etch the inside of the barrel with the rifling, leaving the rest of the bore untouched. Hopefully this will prove to be as easy as it sounds.</p>
