    <p style="text-align:center"> I wanted to build a higher-powered rifle with a locked breech for a while, and why not make a belt-fed rifle too? Since a belt-fed rifle will obviously go through a lot of ammunition so this limited me to cheap cartridges for economic reasons. That meant I had to go with, basically, .22lr, 9mm, 5.56mm, or 7.62x39mm. The first two are a little too light for what I wanted. From the last two, 7.62x39 is more powerful while having lower pressures and more case taper, which makes it easier to work with.</p>
		
	<p style="text-align:center"> The design uses a toggle-locked system, similar to the Luger pistol. When the gun is in battery, the toggle is slightly over-center, preventing the bolt from opening. However, unlike the Luger, which unlocks the toggle via recoil operation, the BF762 is gas-operated. A gas piston is pushed <i>forward</i> by the high-pressure gas from a port under the barrel, pulling on a linkage that forces the toggle open. By designing the gas piston to be pulled forward instead of pushed backwards, the piston rod is kept under tension, so that it can be made smaller without buckling. The bolt features vertical grooves that engage with a round from the belt and pull it backwards out of the belt. A flat spring forces the cartridge to slide down the grooves, displacing the previous case and aligning the new cartridge with the chamber. When the bolt closes again, the top of the grooves spring over the next round in the belt. Feeding the belt forward is done via a set of pawls on the left side of the gun, which push the next round into position as the bolt is moving farward, due to the action of a cam on the bottom of the piston rod.</p>
		
	<p style="text-align:center"> The gun is also air-cooled, featuring a large aluminum finned jacket around the barrel. The fit between the jacket and the barrel is not nearly as good as I'd like, but the first 6 inches of the barrel, which usually would get the hottest, have a bronze bushing made that allowed me to get a very close fit with the jacket to maximize heat tranfer. I'm not sure if I'm actually helping anything or not, but at least it looks cool.</p>

	<p style="text-align:center"> While I had initially thought I might try using electro-chemical machining to make the barrel, I ultimately decided I was too busy to experiment with that, so I'm just using a slightly modified M70 barrel.</p>
