		<p style="text-align:center">A specialized pump for obtaining extremely deep vacuums</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"> A turbomolecular pump is a kind of vacuum pump used to generate extremely deep vacuums from an initial "rough" vacuum. They can take a ~1Pa vacuum from a typical vacuum pump and get it down by multiple orders of magnitude. I hope to be able to get to 1 mPa with my pump. My current design uses 5 stages (1 large stage, 2 medium stages, and 2 small stages) and hopefully will run around 50k RPM. The current bearings are cheap ceramic bearings from Amazon (we'll see if they survive). </p>
    
    <p style="text-align:center"> The rotor will have a ring of alternating magnets close to a non-conductive plate that makes up the back of the pump. On the other side (in atmosphere) will be another ring of magnets that the drive motor will spin. This forms a magnetic coupling that allows me to drive the pump without putting a motor inside of the vacuum. This is important because in vacuum the only way for the pump to cool down is through thermal radiation, which doesn't become significant until very high temperatures. I will also try to drive the rotor directly by using the same magnet ring on the rotor as part of a permanent magnet brushless DC motor, or alternatively adding some loops to the rotor and running it like an induction motor. I would have to get/tune some sort of driver circuit, so for now I'm sticking with using an already manufactured motor.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"> The first step was to turn the rotor on the lathe to form the spaces between stages of blades where the stators will be (as seen above). After this, the blades were machined one-by-one with a 3-axis Haas VF-2 CNC machine (Thanks to Dan Gilbert at MIT for access to this!). This 3-axis limit meant the blades had to be done individually, and then the part was manually indexed with a rotary table. This meant I had 3 programs, one for each size of blade, and simply ran the program again for each blade. Cycle time for each blade was only about 2-3 minutes, but there are 66 blades, so it took a while. At all stages, great care was taken to maintain concentricity because balance will be critical to the pump not exploding/detroying bearings. I would have loved to use that Haas VF-2 for the rest of the project, but right after this MIT evacuated all their undergraduates, so the rest of the machining work will be done on my Hermle UWF 1000 at home or done manually.
