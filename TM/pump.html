		<p style="text-align:center">A specialized pump for obtaining extremely deep vacuums</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"> A turbomolecular pump is a kind of vacuum pump used to generate extremely deep vacuums from an initial "rough" vacuum. They can take a ~1Pa vacuum from a typical vacuum pump and get it down by multiple orders of magnitude. I hope to be able to get to 0.001 Pa with my pump. My current design uses 5 stages (1 large stage, 2 medium stages, and 2 small stages) and hopefully will be able to run at at least 75,000 RPM. The bearings will probably be graphite-based air bearings, placed on the high-pressure side. A mechanical seal on the face will help keep the air from the bearing from spoiling the high-pressure-side vacuum. Thrust will be balanced by magnetic repulsion, which I think will be fine for the minimal thrust forces experienced by the rotor.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align:center"> The rotor will have a ring of alternating magnets close to a non-conductive plate that makes up the back of the pump. On the other side (now exposed to the atmosphere) will be a copper disk that the drive motor will spin. The eddy currents in the copper disk allow the motor to drive the rotor indirectly. This allows the motor to be placed in the air so it can be kept cool. The eddy currents in the copper disk will also make it hot, so putting it on the atmospheric side helps to keep it cool. This is a big deal because inside the pump, the only way for anything to cool is by radiation, so things can easily get very hot. </p>
