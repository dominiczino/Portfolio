		<p style="text-align:center">Making some new buildings for storage.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"> We have a lot of equipment and machinery and a lot of it is currently stored outside, exposed (or at best, semi-exposed) to the elements. Lots of things are stuffed into our currently cramped storage buildings and shops, so we desperately need more facilities to store equipment, machinery, and components. To deal with this, I'm designing and building three new buildings on our property. One will actually just be a shelter for the sawmill, another will act as a garage of sorts for the bulldozers, crane, and excavator, while the last one will just be normal storage of pallets, crates, etc. </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center">The buildings have been designed with timber-framed construction in mind, to allow for cheap construction, and in keeping with the architectural theme of our other facilities. This can be quite helpful in the design, since it allows for very long spans without columns due to the large dimensions of the joists, and allows the 1000sq ft buildings to stand on just 10 columns. This does require large concrete posts, however.</p>
